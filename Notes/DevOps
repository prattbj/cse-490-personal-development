Stages of DevOps

Plan - Use tools such as Atlassian/Trello to create tasks
Code - Use an IDE
Build - Use different environments (Operating systems, high-end vs low-end systems, etc...) to make sure your code will work for the client
Test - Explore edge cases within the application you built, run tests that you have programmed to make sure everything functions properly
Release - Set up your build for production
Deploy - Tools that host your server like a cloud service to allow end users to interact with it
Operate - Either working with the cloud service or upgrading your infrastucture to handle the requests 
Monitor - Same as operate but monitor instead of handle

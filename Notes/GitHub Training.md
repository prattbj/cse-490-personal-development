* What I Learned

For the most part, I am experienced with working on GitHub repositories with a team. I understand how and why to create branches and how to merge correctly.

However, seeing how complex it gets when working with a larger group on a larger project gives more perspective and technique. 

Instead of having one main branch and one individual branch per person, we will have an entire tree with new branches being made each sprint.

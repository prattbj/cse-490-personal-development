* What I Learned

I have already had experience with test driven development in my software design courses. 

We use test driven development as part of the Agile methodology in order to ensure the
requirements of the stakeholders are met.

As we write tests before writing the code, our code must fulfill the requirements or else 
the tests fail and our manager/team lead knows our tests failed and the software isn't up 
to specification.

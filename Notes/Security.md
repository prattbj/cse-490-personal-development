Authentication - verification that something is what it says it is
Authorization - verification that something is allowed to perform an action
Access - The ability to perform an action, such as enter a building, view code, or change a repository

Given the ability to login without 2FA there is a possibility an account is accessed, causing it to be stolen.
Given the ability to change the information without authentication, there is a risk that an account's email and passoword are changed, causing it to be stolen.
Given the ability to access information about other users, there is a risk that said information can be used to find personal details about the user, allowing for connecting information from other sites to be used to dox or harrass the user.

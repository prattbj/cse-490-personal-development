* Performance 

Our team had less consistency getting everybody together for the meetings, but we put out a lot more work

GitHub workflows are very difficult to figure out. I can run one, but I am not sure about integrating it with the project.
Once we get into the development teams rather than the research and setup teams, this will become easier.

Goal: start writing code soon
